##Removing things

###Get the clone process started: content-Aware Fill

The `Content-Aware Fill` tool is great for beginning the removal process of certain items.

##Adding things

###Does my composite match?

1. __Check the lighting.__ Create a channel mixer adjustment layer. Change to monochrome, so the image is only black and white. If any adjustments need to be made, this edit should make that apparent. We can add `Levels` or `Curves` adjustment layers to fix this issue if needed.

2. __Make sure the background saturation matches the saturation of the foreground.__ Create a `Color fill` layer, a layer with just a solid color, in bright red. Change the blending mode of that layer to `Hue`. This mode makes the most saturated areas to appear more red than the other areas of the image. This will illuminate which areas don't match the color of the foreground image. 
For example, add colored lighting where necessary. Create a new layer, use the `Eyedropper Tool` to select colors from the foreground/background, and paint where colored lighting is needed. Change the blending mode of this layer to `Soft Light` so that it matches the lighting of the layer it's applied to.  

3. __Color matching with `Curves`__: Use the `Curves` adjustment layer to change the prevalence of different colos in a layer.

4. __Blend everything together.__: Add a couple of adjustment layers over the whole image to improve the blending of the two together. Add a `Color balance` adjustment layer, altering the highlights and shadows.. 
5. Add a `Levels` adjustment layer to add a little bit of blue to the shadows and some yellows to the highlights. 
6. Add a layer in plain white. Go to blending options. At the bottom of the window in the `Blend if` section, drag the sliders such that the white will only apply to the highlights.
